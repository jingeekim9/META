## Overview

Welcome to the Metaverse Shopping App! This React Native application leverages the power of the metaverse to enhance your shopping experience for clothes. With a seamless blend of virtual and real-world shopping, our app brings you a unique and immersive way to explore, try on, and purchase your favorite clothing items.
